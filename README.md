# CG1112_Alex_Group4

Alex folder contains the alex_main node which is a custom made ros package which enables alex to move using I/J/K/L keys and interactive marker feedback

The drag_and_drop folder contains another package which is an edited version of the interactive_marker_tutorial basic_controls node:
https://github.com/ros-visualization/visualization_tutorials/blob/indigo-devel/interactive_marker_tutorials/src/basic_controls.cpp

Furthermore, our team used the teleop_twist_keyboard package (without any edits so not included in this repository) from:
https://github.com/ros-teleop/teleop_twist_keyboard

The Baremetal arduino code is in the baremetal4 folder. Code for motors is in baremetal, code for UART is not.
